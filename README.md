## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)

### What I learned

Basically, I used html,css and bootstrap library to create this design which is suitable for viewing on devices of different width. It also helps me in understanding the concept of padding,margins and borders.

### Continued development

I need to brush up my bootstrap concept and need to learn to use media queries for future projects which will helps me in making more user-friendly websites as per device-width.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - This helped me in accessing the class,keywords of bootstrap library. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand html and css concepts. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
